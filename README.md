### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Yuki-Fujiwara-S/Yuki-Fujiwara-S** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a dog identifying app using tensor flow!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, TypeScript and CSS
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about languages, food and podcasts! (and my love for Arsenal FC)
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: (he/him)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I know how to say "I like cheese" in 10+ languages.
